# Python Projects üêç

This repository contains small Python projects for learning and practice.  
Each project is organized in its own directory and has its own README file.

## Projects

- **Guessing Game**: A simple game where the player guesses a number.
- **X-O Game**: Classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.

More projects will be added soon as I continue learning.
